The Supernote A6X2 from Ratta is a really great digital notebook and a lot more.
As this device can be quickly integrated into everyday life and becomes an indispensable companion, I quickly felt the need for more personalization.
For this reason, for example, I often change the screensaver. This is always visible when the device is not in use, i.e. when it is in standby.
Although the Supernote can automatically scale imported images, the best results are still achieved if you convert these images to grayscale beforehand and make them the perfect size for the Supernote screen.

As I had some time between two projects, I wrote a little helper in the meantime that allows me to convert JPEGs, BMPs and PNGs into a grayscale image using drag & drop and export them in the correctly scaled size for the Supernote. This helper can also correct contrast and brightness so that the screensaver image always shines in the best light on the Supernote.

I hope I can make someone happy by publishing this little helper. :-)
